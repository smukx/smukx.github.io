            At that time where it all begins . i able to seek things as it was denied to force . what is the difference between you and them . They just shows off , we made through it . </p>
        <p> Im'a Pentester, Hacker , Network Analyst , Linux Enthusiastic, and an It'Guy . But Still a College guy .</p><br><br>
        
        <p> If you are at the hacking field for atleast an year . you can Feel my pain when Friends ask this type of help eg: Hack Insta-acc, snap-acc etc ..</p>
        <br>
        <p> Dont Ask me to Pwn Stupid Social-Media ie: Instugumu(Ig) . Please Stop it.</p>
        <p> Dont Ask me to Pwn ur GirlFriend Accounts , cause they need some Privacy too ;] </p><br>

      <h2> Some Inspired Quotes :</h2>
      
      <p>Talk is Cheap , Show me The Code ~ Linus Torvalds</p>
      <p>In the realm of 1s and 0s, where logic weaves a tapestry of algorithms, the code whisperers dwell, decrypting the symphony of bytes, sculpting worlds from the ether ~ Smukx</p>
      <p> Amidst the lines of code, my essence thrives. No need for grand claims or boastful proclamations. Let my source code speak, revealing the intricate symphony of my being, whispering my true prowess to those who seek. ~ Smukx </p>
